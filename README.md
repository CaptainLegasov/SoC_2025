Optimization with LP solvers<br>

In week 1 and 2, I gained the knowlegde to mathematically formulate linear programming problems by going through IE501 notes, also I learned theory regarding convex optimization.<br>
In week 3, I learned how to use solvers like Gurobi and PuLP to solve problems like LP, MILP, Integer programming.<br>

In week 4, I completed assignment problems.<br>
